# pip-boii
Pentest from your wrist-mounted Vault-Tec network interface!

So here's the skinny. Ever since I started playing fallout (not important if you don't know what that means), I've thought about wearbles that can actually do a light load of processing. My first thought was of what already exists out there: stick a phone in the pip-boy wearable and BAM, done. Right?

What if you want an actual desktop on that? What if you don't want Android? What if you want to change what repos are in your sources.list? That's what pip-boii is here for.
